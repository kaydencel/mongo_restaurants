K. Lin - DS 4300

# Description
I used a json file of restaurants in New York City. With this data, I created questions pertaining this data that it could answer. I created 10 mongo queries that got data to answer
the questions. Using the mongo queries, I created API functions in Python and created visualizations from the data.
